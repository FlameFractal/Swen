## Building the third screen of the app - Post page



### UI

The ui is very bare bones on this page. There's one text input field for Headline and it has a minimum restriction of 10 characters. There's another textarea input field for Content and it has a minimum restriction of 120 characters. And there's a submit button. The input fields are cleared on submission success and a toast is shown.

**Thing that could be improved (in no particular order):**

- Use a rich text editor like Ace Editor
- Have a circular loader near submit button, disable both inputs until data query succeeds.



### Backend

If the content of both the input fields exceeds the respective minimum character restrictions, then it is added to the database for the current gps location. 

**Thing that could be improved (in no particular order):**

- Article header image, hosting support using Hasura FileStore API (already supported in the frontend) 



### Improvements

- Collapsible hamburger menu on small screens.
