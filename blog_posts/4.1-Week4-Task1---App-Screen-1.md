## Building the first screen of the app - Homepage



### UI

I started out by building the UI. I picked MaterialCSS library for the front-end. I spent a little while going through their documentation to make myself familiar of what components are available and such.

I began with putting together the navigation bar, the three buttons. The Location button has a Pulse effect to draw attention of the user. The reason why I didn't use geolocation by default is that there may not be any posts in the location the person is in, for prototyping reasons. Then created the header "The Daily Post" followed by the "Card Reveal" type of material card for the articles. Although I initially planned on using a pop-up modal to show the news, the card-reveal looked more modern so I chose that. But I don't have any images associated with the articles so I put up a grey image for all. This is very temporary and can be changed to modal with few lines of code. 

Then I created a circular preloader in the centre of the screen that shows up when articles are being fetched in the background and then hides away. The actual homepage.html file only contains the code for preloader in the body, as the header and articles are templated on client side (in script.js) once the articles for current location are fetched.



**Thing that could be improved (in no particular order):**

- On scrolling down, hide the header slowly (similar to Beautifull Jekyll) and show the header in the navbar (like in the validate page).
- Hide the navbar buttons on mobile and show hamburger menu instead (*Completed in Task 4.3*)
- Use React or Semantic UI for the frontend.
- Show only 6 articles and load more articles dynamically on every scroll down.
- Monitor location on all pages. If location is changed on any page, reflect the change on all tabs. *(Completed in Task 4.2)*

### Backend

The backend is in node.js, but all it does is serve all the static files using express.js. And a little bit of route handling to make URLs pretty. There is nothing else handled on the backend.

The articles on the homepage are templated using client side javascript by communicating directly with the Hasura Data API with custom Hasura code in JSON format. A query is made to the Data API to fetch 

1. Articles 
2. for current location (default="Tatooine")
3. that are valid (community-verified) 
4. in descending order of date (recent first)

Once these articles are fetched, they are templated and added onto the page along with the header and navbar. And the circular preloader is hidden.

A person can "refresh" his location by clicking on the Location button in the navbar, in that case, the preloader is shown again and the row of articles is deleted. Once coordinates are received using the HTML5 Geolocation, the sub-locality is obtained using Google Maps reverse-geocode API. Then a new query is made to the Hasura Data API to fetch the articles for this new location. And they are templated, shown, and the preloader hidden again.

These are all the functions right now in the script.js

**Thing that could be improved (in no particular order):**

- Rewrite all the `js` files and take out common redundant functions, instead of having 3 files for 3 pages.
- Reduce hasura-min.js load time by removing the hasura-js-sdk and using curl.
