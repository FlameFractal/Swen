## Building the second screen of the app - Validate Page



### UI

The UI of validate page was exactly the same as homepage. The only difference was the Upvote and Downvote buttons with every article.

### Backend

Everything same as the homepage. Invalid articles are fetched from the database and templated on client side.

Raw SQL mode in Hasura Data API was used to increment/decrement the votes onClick of the buttons.

```
hasura.data.query({
    	"type": "run_sql",
    	"args": {
        	"sql": "UPDATE article SET votes = votes "+type+" WHERE id = "+post_id
    	}
});
```



A trigger was made at the backend to make the status of a post as "Valid" whenever it reaches 20 votes.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION validate_votes()  
  RETURNS TRIGGER AS  
$$  
BEGIN  
IF OLD.votes >= 20 THEN
NEW.status:='valid';  
END IF;
RETURN NEW;  
END;  
$$  
LANGUAGE 'plpgsql';  


CREATE TRIGGER validate_trig  
  BEFORE UPDATE  
  ON article
  FOR EACH ROW  
  EXECUTE PROCEDURE validate_votes();  
```



### Improvements

- Consider the case where homepage and validate pages are open in separate tabs of a browser. If a person re-locates himself in one tab, the location should automatically change in other tab too. 
  - This was accomplished by storing location in localStorage and then calling a function to compare the local variable gpsLocation to the value in localStorage every 1 second using setIntervalTime
  - This code was added to homepage.js as well as validate.js



**Thing that could be improved (in no particular order):**

- Increment column using Hasura Data API instead of raw_sql mode (UPDATE mytable SET votes = votes + 1  WHERE id = 12)
