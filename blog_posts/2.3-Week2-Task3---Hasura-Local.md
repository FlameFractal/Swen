Installing Hasura locally is very straightforward since after commit ` b364a964e8ccbe` in the repo [hasura/local-development](https://github.com/hasura/local-development/) with the introduction of the `hasuractl` tool. 

One only has to download VirtualBox and `kubectl` themselves. The `hasuractl` downloads `minikube` ISO and configures the VM and the Hasura platform inside, using `kubectl` itself.

The detailed explanation of what's happening behind the scenes along with what exactly does the Hasura platform does are explained by [Tanmai](https://twitter.com/tanmaigo) sir in this [webinar](https://www.facebook.com/HasuraHQ/videos/1324094457657553/). 



A basic hierarchy diagram is as follows:
