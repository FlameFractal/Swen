### Why prototype?

It is widely acknowledged in the computer and design industries that, before spending too much time and resources into making a product it is always good to have a "prototype". 

Software prototypes allow the stakeholders to get a feel of how the software might end up. It isn't considered as the final design model or language, but at the same time serves as a good enough base point for the design and interaction. 

The advantages of making prototypes are reduced costs and increased involvement of the users. [Elon Musk once said](https://youtu.be/VHOieemErbg?t=4m56s), "I think it's important to take feedback from your environment" while developing email payments at PayPal.

### What prototype?

Software prototypes can be of many types - hand-sketched wireframes, digital wireframes, and semi-working prototypes.

[Proto.io](http://proto.io) is a fairly advanced tool for making prototypes. It allows you to design semi-working prototypes with complex features like variables, transitions, interactions, grouping and such. It also includes ton of font support and different component libraries like Material Design, Android, iOS etc.

Here is a screencast video (and gif below) of how the Proto.io tool helps to design -

### My prototype

The 3 screens involved in my MVP are

- Homepage (to read the verified local news)
- Validate page (to read/verify the unverified local news)
- Post page (to post new news articles for that area)



Here is a screen recording (and gif below) of the Proto.io player in action in using the working prototype.
