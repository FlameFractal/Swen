This is a series of blogposts written as part of an Internship [@Hasura](https://hasura.io). You can read the next post at [App Idea](/posts/6). Scroll to the bottom of this post for all the posts in this series!

The successful culmination of the IMAD course resulted in this work-from-home internship at Hasura. The internship consists of various tasks to accomplish creating an app using the Hasura platform.

As we have to document our journey in form of blogposts, what better way than using the Blog webapp made as part of the IMAD course itself, to accomplish that. For the next 8 weeks or so, I'll be posting here to keep the progress documented and up to date.

Let's roll!
