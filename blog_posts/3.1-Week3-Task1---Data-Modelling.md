## Data to be captured

The data to be captured from the app is:

- All screens
  - Location (for displaying location-relevant articles on homepage and validate page, and for new articles being posted)
- Validate screen
  - Post ID (for upvoting/downvoting an article)
- Post screen
  - New article timestamp
  - New article headline
  - New article content






## Schema Modelling

Only these 4 pieces of information have to be captured for these 3 pages in MVP.

- Two tables will exist in the data model. 
- `Article.status` will be a foreign key. 
- `Status.status_name` will have entries {`Validated`, `Unvalidated`} which will act as `enum` for the `Article.status` field.

## Required APIs

Following API Endpoints would need to be there to ensure the functioning of the app (along with respective server-side validity checks)

#### 1. Homepage View API

- GET valid posts FOR `currentLocation` SUCH THAT latest-date-first AND random order within a date

- future - support pagination


#### 2. Validate View API

- GET invalid posts FOR `currentLocation` SUCH THAT latest-date-first AND random order within a date

- future - support pagination


#### 3. Vote APIs

- INC/DEC vote column for post `id` (checking invalidity of post id)

- future - have separate upvote/downvote column. 


#### 4. New Post API

- INSERT `currentLocation`, `timestamp`, `headline`, `content` into article

- future - compare location with IP check , to avoid people fooling the API
